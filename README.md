# Machine-Learning

1.) -Overview: The Kaggle project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict a protein's thermostability (a real-valued score) using its amino acid sequence as input. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras libraries and focuses on handling sequence data for prediction tasks.

-train.csv: Training data file. 

-test.csv: Test data file for which predictions will be made. 

-Model Details Model Architecture: Uses an embedding layer, followed by a bidirectional LSTM and dense layers.

-Training: Trained with a validation split of 20% for 20 epochs. 

-Output: Predictions are saved in prediction.csv.

2.) HW assignment: 
-Focus on exploring the features and analyze how each of these features relates to the target variable and assess the strength of the correlation.

-Task 2: Develop the gradient descent algorithm to perform linear regression.

-Ensure to update the parameters iteratively to minimize the MSE according to the provided formula.

-Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) on your training set and on your test set at the final iteration of your gradient descent algorithm.

-Create a plot that displays the predicted diabetes progression versus the actual data.
